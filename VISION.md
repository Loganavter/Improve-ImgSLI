# Project Vision

This document preserves the author's personal perspective on Improve-ImgSLI and has been moved out of the main README to keep it concise and user-oriented.

## My Personal View

The genesis of Improve ImgSLI was a practical need: to create clear visual comparisons for an article. The initial design, and indeed the name, drew inspiration from imgsli.com. While the early iterations were functional, the project has since evolved significantly.

Today, I view Improve ImgSLI as a valuable public asset, much like [VideoCut](https://github.com/kanehekili/VideoCut) Kanehekili, another tool whose principles partially guided its development and which has become indispensable in my own workflow. The core value of Improve ImgSLI lies in its efficiency. Manually creating detailed image comparisons can be a laborious process, often taking several minutes. This program accomplishes the same, often superior, results in approximately 30 seconds, all through an intuitive, user-friendly interface. It's this transformation of a cumbersome task into a swift, accessible one that I believe makes Improve ImgSLI a genuinely useful tool.

It's difficult to pinpoint the exact time spent on the project, but I would estimate it to be approximately 130â€“250 hours in total, excluding the time required for package construction. Since then I found a more favorable LLM provider and now rely on Kilo Code + Gemini in my workflow, which comfortably covers my needs without issues.
