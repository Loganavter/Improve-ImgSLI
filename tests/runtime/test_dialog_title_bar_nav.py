"""CSD title-bar keyboard ownership for dialog windows.

Symptom (audit 2026-10-19, rank 3): three CSD-decorated dialogs had a title
bar no navigation section owned — Help (decorated, never registered), the
video editor (Help trigger + close, title bar outside its one modal row
section) and the colour picker (its close was outside the four declared
rows). The window-control buttons are also created ``NoFocus`` by the
toolkit, so even a registered section had nothing to land on.

Contract under test:

* ``register_dialog_title_bar_navigation(dialog)`` registers ONE
  ``TitleBarNavigationSection`` for the dialog's bar (idempotent);
* the bar's close button is a real keyboard focus stop the section owns;
* Down from the bar enters the dialog's first visual row;
* Up from that first row returns to the bar, or — where the dialog's own
  section is registered after the bar (video editor's modal ceiling, the
  picker's show-time bar) — is consumed at the top with focus unchanged;
* Enter on the focused close button closes the dialog.

Falsification (pre-change tree): no section is registered for the bar and
the close button is ``NoFocus`` — it is absent from
``bar._focusable_buttons()`` (the video editor's bar then lands on the Help
trigger only), so every assertion here is red before the helper exists.

Real dialogs, real ``QTest`` presses and the real app-wide
``NavigationManager`` dispatch throughout — no bespoke key filter.
