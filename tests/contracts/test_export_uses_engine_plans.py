"""S3: IC export plan-build resolves LOD/tiles through the R4 engine vocabulary.

Pins the Phase S-c seam (task-engine-next-migration-2026-09-16, ruling 3:
parity by construction, harness as tripwire):

* ``snapshot_render_plan_builder`` imports the engine tile vocabulary
  (``engine.cache.draw_plans.plan_tiles_for_grid``) and enumerates export
  tiles through it -- never through a tab-local ``visible_tiles`` call.
* LOD is picked through exactly one wrapper
  (``resolve_export_lod_level``) over ``engine.cache.lod.select_level``;
  the single ``select_level`` call site in the module is that wrapper.
* ``snapshot_lod_tiles_for_sources`` is a thin harness-compat delegate over
  the same engine-backed core (``resolve_export_snapshot_lod_tiles``) --
  no second implementation (ruling 2).
* ``SnapshotRenderPlanBuilder.build_render_plan`` exercises that core, so
  export LOD/tile decisions come from the R4 vocabulary by construction;
  ``test_live_export_parity.py`` stays the tripwire (kept green, never
  weakened here).
* rg invariant: tab-local export LOD/tile decision code is zero outside an
  explicit allow-list. Prescale/resample + pure-geometry helpers
  (``prescale_pair``, ``fit_source_to_content``, ``resolve_prescale_target``,
  ...) are out of scope per the harness docstring -- they are named in the
  allow-list below so the invariant stays checkable instead of drifting.

S3 owns this file; S4 extends it only by supervisor ruling. Keep the
engine-call seam minimal: one entry used by export
(``resolve_export_snapshot_lod_tiles``); do not fork the R4 API.
