"""Capability gate: every accepted suffix must be readable by a real decoder.

``shared.image_extensions.ACCEPTED_IMAGE_EXTENSIONS`` is a *claim* about the
installed decoders. It had already drifted once: ``.avif`` decoded fine
(Pillow and libvips both read it) while the static list -- which drives DnD,
file-dialog filters and the gallery folder scan -- still bounced the file, so
the same image opened when passed programmatically and was rejected by every
entry point. Adding a suffix by hand is therefore never enough: this gate
fails unless a decoder on *this* machine actually reads it.

Rule per suffix:

* **Pillow-backed** (the main path -- ``tiled_pixel_store``,
  ``pyramid_pixel_store`` and the preview loaders all decode through it): the
  suffix must appear in ``PIL.Image.registered_extensions()`` **and** its
  format must be one Pillow can open (``Image.OPEN``), not merely write.
* **Content alias** (``.mpo``): Pillow registers the suffix for save only --
  upstream has its ``register_open`` commented out -- but an MPO file is a
  plain JPEG stream per picture, so ``Image.open`` sniffs it. The alias table
  below names the opener format explicitly instead of leaving a hole; the
  decode itself is proven by the runtime round trip.
* **Alternative backend**: a suffix Pillow has no plugin for (``.jxl``:
  decoded by libvips/``imagecodecs``) is allowed only through
  :data:`NON_PILLOW_ALLOWLIST`, which names the reason and whose claim is
  re-checked here (``pyvips.get_suffixes()``). The allowlist is
  **shrink-only**: a stale entry -- Pillow registers the suffix now, so the
  entry is no longer needed -- fails just as loudly as a missing one.
* Anything else fails. That is the "the list cannot drift again" property.

Beyond the static claim the file pins the three things a suffix list can get
wrong without any decoder being missing:

* **runtime round trip** -- for every accepted suffix this stack can *write*,
  a tiny sample is encoded into ``tmp_path`` and driven through the real intake
  (``is_loadable_image_path`` -> ``get_image_dimensions`` ->
  ``load_preview_image``). A suffix with no writer here is an explicit
  ``skip`` naming the suffix and the missing writer, never a silent pass, so
  the report shows exactly which formats were proven and which were not.
* **group layout** -- ``FIRST_FRAME_SUFFIXES`` (admitted, but only one frame is
  shown) is a subset of the canon, and the refused suffixes live in a disjoint
  table with a reason each (``test_rejected_formats_have_reasons.py``).
* **content-type coverage** -- every accepted suffix has a ``_EXT_TO_MIME``
  entry whose value composes a valid ``image/*`` media type, so an accepted
  file cannot be uploaded labelled as a different format (``.jxl`` used to ship
  as ``png``).

The final test feeds :func:`unsupported_suffixes` a suffix no backend has, so
a checker that accepted everything (or was never wired to the real set) would
be caught instead of passing by accident.
