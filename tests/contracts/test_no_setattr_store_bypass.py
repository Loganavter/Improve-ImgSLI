"""No ``setattr``-based Store bypass outside Dispatcher/Reducer.

Covers ``docs/dev/CONTRACTS.md`` / ``docs/dev/STORE.md`` invariants 1-2::

    Action ──► Dispatcher.dispatch ──► RootReducer.reduce (replace) ──► Store

Sibling ``test_no_direct_store_mutation.py`` catches only ``store.x.y = v``
``Assign`` syntax. This dogma closes the ``ast.Call`` hole: several call
sites spell the same in-place mutation as ``setattr(store_obj, ...,
value)`` — e.g. ``session_persistence.py`` comments admit using
``setattr`` "to avoid Assign dogma". The effect is identical (lock /
history / subscribers / session re-pointing skipped), so it fails the
same way.

Two shapes are flagged for ``setattr(target, name, value)``:

* (A) the first-arg chain contains an ``INTERMEDIATE`` Store-owned attr
  (``session_data`` / ``image_state`` / ``render_cache`` / ``document`` /
  ``viewport`` / ``render_config`` / ``view_state`` / ...), or
* (B) the attribute *name* literal itself is an ``INTERMEDIATE`` member —
  this covers the ``setattr(session, "document", doc)`` fallback shape in
  ``use_cases/persistence.py`` whose first-arg chain is a bare ``session``
  root and would otherwise be invisible.

Helpers (``INTERMEDIATE``, ``EXEMPT``, ``_get_chain``,
``_collect_transients``) are reused by import from the sibling module —
not fork-duplicated — so the two dogmas cannot drift apart.

RATCHET: ``ALLOWLIST`` pins every pre-existing site found on the current
tree; ``PENDING_MIGRATION`` tolerates the persistence-path offenders that
are being fixed in parallel. A new ``setattr`` bypass fails; a stale
``PENDING_MIGRATION`` entry (site already migrated) fails too, forcing
exemption cleanup at integration.

Known blind spot (documented, not scanned): ``setattr`` whose target is
itself a ``Call`` (``_get_chain`` returns ``None``), e.g.
``setattr(controller.store.get_session_state_slot('document'), ...)`` in
``use_cases/slot.py:322`` and ``setattr(get_magnifier_widget_state(...),
...)`` in ``magnifier/properties.py``. Extending the scan there is
supervisor follow-up work.
