"""Capability gate: every *offered* export format must be really writable.

``writable_formats()`` is a claim about the installed encoders, and it drives
the export dialog's format combo for both comparison tabs. That pair had
already drifted: the combo offered ``JXL`` to both tabs while only one tab had
a JXL encoder branch — the other handed ``format="JXL"`` straight to Pillow,
which has no JXL plugin, so the save died with ``KeyError: 'JXL'`` after the
user had configured everything. Offering a format is therefore never a static
list decision; this gate fails unless an encoder on *this* machine really
produces it.

Rule per format:

* **Pillow-backed** (the primary writer, ``shared.image_processing.
  format_capability.encode``): the format must appear in ``PIL.Image.SAVE``
  (the encoder registry, not the decoder one) of the installed build.
* **Alternative backend**: a format Pillow has no encoder for is allowed only
  through :data:`NON_PILLOW_ALLOWLIST`, which names the reason and the backend.
  The claim is re-probed here *independently* of the module under test — if the
  backend cannot encode on this machine the format must not be offered. The
  allowlist is **shrink-only**: an entry whose format Pillow encodes now is
  stale and fails just as loudly as a missing one.
* Anything else fails.

The last tests keep the gate from being vacuous: :func:`unsupported_formats`
is fed a format no backend has (and must report it), the format row of the
export dialog is read from its AST (it must iterate ``writable_formats()`` and
must not re-introduce a literal list), and every offered format is required to
round-trip through the shared writer. The end-to-end claim for the multi-
compare *service* (the path that crashed with ``KeyError: 'JXL'``) lives in
that tab's own suite, because root tests must not deep-import tab internals.
