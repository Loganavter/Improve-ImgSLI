  <summary>Image comparison with magnifier</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      Improve ImgSLI is a versatile open-source tool designed for detailed side-by-side image comparison. Easily spot differences and inspect fine details using its synchronized magnifying glass feature. Ideal for designers, photographers, AI art/upscaling enthusiasts, and anyone needing precise visual analysis.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Compare images with an adjustable horizontal or vertical split line.</li>
      <li>Use the powerful synchronized magnifier with flexible controls: adjustable capture/display size, position control (mouse and WASD/QE keys), view freezing, and combined magnifiers.</li>
      <li>Load single or multiple images per comparison panel via drag-and-drop or file dialogs.</li>
      <li>Easily switch between loaded images using dropdown selectors.</li>
      <li>Save the complete comparison view (including split line, magnifier markers, and optional filenames) as a full-resolution image.</li>
      <li>Swap image lists between panels with a single click.</li>
      <li>Edit displayed file names directly within the interface.</li>
      <li>Multi-language interface (English, Russian, Chinese, Brazilian Portuguese) with persistent settings.</li>
      <li>Selectable interpolation methods for the magnifier (Nearest Neighbor, Bilinear, Bicubic, Lanczos).</li>
      <li>Quick preview of individual images using Space + Mouse Buttons.</li>
      <li>Improved performance with image caching.</li>
    </ul>

    <release version="7.9.0" date="2025-10-27">
      <description>
        <p>This release includes various improvements and bug fixes.</p>
      </description>
    </release>
    <release version="6.2.0" date="2025-08-16">
      <description>
        <p>This is the most extensive architectural refactoring in the project's history, transitioning the entire application to a robust and modern Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern. This update establishes a new, stable foundation for future development and introduces a completely custom-built UI.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Complete Architectural Overhaul: The codebase is now fully modular and based on the MVP pattern, significantly improving stability and maintainability. Many underlying bugs have been passively fixed as a result.</li>
          <li>New Custom UI: The third-party `PyQt-Fluent-Widgets` library has been removed and replaced with a custom-built set of "fluent-style" components. This removes GPL licensing constraints and gives the application a more unique design.</li>
          <li>Enhanced Image List Management: The image selection flyout is now a powerful two-panel manager with full drag-and-drop support for reordering and moving images between lists.</li>
          <li>New and Reimagined Dialogs: Introduced a dedicated, feature-rich Export dialog and a redesigned, easier-to-navigate Help window.</li>
          <li>Improved Caching: The caching system has been upgraded from two to three levels for even smoother performance during interactive use.</li>
          <li>Reduced Package Size: The removal of the external UI library has decreased the application's overall size on some platforms.</li>
        </ul>

    <release version="5.8.20" date="2025-07-09">
      <description>
        <p>This is a major quality-of-life and rendering engine update.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Overhauled the core update logic to a reactive, state-driven architecture, significantly improving stability and eliminating a class of race-condition bugs.</li>
          <li>The magnifier can now render outside the image boundaries and correctly handles horizontal split view.</li>
          <li>Added smooth, anti-aliased borders for the magnifier and capture area for better visual quality.</li>
          <li>Added long-press actions for swapping and clearing images/lists to speed up workflow.</li>
          <li>Image selection dropdowns are now scrollable with the mouse wheel.</li>
          <li>Added a new setting to permanently enable or disable debug logging.</li>
          <li>Replaced all internal print statements with a structured logging system.</li>
        </ul>

      <description>
        <p>This release introduces a major user interface overhaul and performance improvements.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The application interface has been completely redesigned using the modern `qfluentwidgets` style.</li>
          <li>The image caching service has been significantly improved, resulting in a much smoother experience.</li>
          <li>Refactored the core rendering code for better performance and easier maintenance.</li>

          <li>Introduced a new Settings dialog to centralize application preferences.</li>
          <li>Added options to configure UI language, JPEG save quality, and the maximum length of displayed filenames.</li>
