"""Which image formats this build can actually *write* — one home, one writer.

Two drifts this module closes:

* **The offer outran the encoders.** The export dialog offered ``JXL`` to both
  comparison tabs, but only one tab had a JXL branch (through ``imagecodecs``)
  and the other handed ``format="JXL"`` straight to Pillow, which has no JXL
  plugin at all — ``KeyError: 'JXL'`` on save. A format may only be offered
  when :func:`writable_formats` proves an installed encoder produces it.
* **The alpha policy had two copies.** ``export_encoding`` and ``pil_save``
  each carried their own ``{"PNG", "TIFF", "WEBP", "JXL"}`` set, so a format
  added to one stayed flattened-to-RGB in the other. :func:`formats_with_alpha`
  is the single definition now.

Callers get one writer (:func:`encode`) instead of re-implementing the
Pillow-vs-alternative-backend fork: Pillow for the formats it registers,
``imagecodecs`` for JXL. Cancellation and progress behave the same on both
paths — a cancel still aborts the write and leaves no file at the final path.

Lives in ``shared`` (not the engine) on purpose: the engine may import
``shared`` but must never name ``tabs.*`` / ``plugins.*``, and both tabs plus
the shared dialog read this module — ``shared/image_processing`` is the only
layer all of them already depend on.

Re-verified by ``tests/contracts/test_export_formats_match_encoders.py``:
it fails if this module offers a format no installed encoder writes, and if
the export dialog offers anything else.
