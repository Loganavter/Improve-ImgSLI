"""Image pyramid builds: demand kicks, progress tracking, canvas updates.

The pyramid provides tiled LOD (level-of-detail) for GPU rendering.
Each full-res image store gets a pyramid whose levels build progressively
in a background worker, emitting per-level progress signals.

Demand policy (GIMP-style, IC slots to demand pyramid): unify completion
kicks :meth:`PyramidBuildCoordinator.demand_level` for the fit-view level
(``select_level`` over the full ``estimate_total_levels`` count — QL
parity, ``image_gallery/ui/quick_look/preview_canvas.py``) instead of the
eager full ``start_build``. Coarse/fit levels land; coarser levels wait
for a zoom-out that needs them via :func:`demand_for_zoom`. The engine
builds finest-first, so every level ``<= k_fit`` lands as a side effect
of demanding ``k_fit`` and zoom-ins stay on resident levels (no rebuild).

Toast progress is managed via the controller's bound methods
(``controller._finish_loading_toast``, etc.) — the dependency is
one-directional: **pyramid --> toast** (see ``loading_toast.py``).
