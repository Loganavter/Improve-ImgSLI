"""Which pixels does a side's SOURCE role mean? (the loupe's raw material)

The image-compare render plan carries two roles per side:

* DISPLAY — what the canvas paints. After ``unify_pair`` both sides live on the
  common canvas size (max w/h per side), so the smaller image is an UPSALED copy.
* SOURCE — what the magnifier samples through ``widget._source_texture_ids``
  ("source_0"/"source_1"). It must be the side's OWN decoded pixels, or the
  loupe magnifies an upscaled copy: measured live 2026-10-26 with
  ``IMGSLI_TILE_DUMP=1`` on a 2816x2304 + 768x576 pair, both source grids were
  registered at 2816x2304 and the loupe over the small side was mush that got
  worse when the canvas was zoomed.

Why this module exists: the role used to be a silent default —
``build_canvas_plan`` filled an omitted source with the DISPLAY image, so every
caller that did not name a source implicitly asked the loupe to magnify the
unify result. One resolver, used by the plan default and by the presentation,
keeps the role honest in one place.
