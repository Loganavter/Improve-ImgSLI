"""Startup placeholder / zoom indicator / focus-dim chrome for ``MultiCompareWidget``.

Split out of ``widget.py`` to keep that class down to composition/wiring --
mirrors the ``drag_drop`` split. Every function here takes the widget as its
first argument and reads/writes its instance state directly.

Qt calls ``resizeEvent``/``hideEvent``/``showEvent`` by name on the widget
itself, so those stay defined as thin methods on ``MultiCompareWidget`` that
delegate into this module.

    whole first drag — RASTER+COMMIT happen underneath it, invisibly. After
    the first drop, uploads/mip-cascades drive enough frames to cross the

    crosses at startup and it never hits this.)
