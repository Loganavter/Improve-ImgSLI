        Several operations are semantically one user-visible transition but

        + ``close_workspace_session`` when the session picker is replaced by a
        new session). Emitting per step makes the workspace UI sync to each
        intermediate state — and the adaptive tab strip legitimately holds
        *two* tabs between those steps, so an intermediate frame shows two tabs
        before the replacement lands. Batching defers every emission until the
        block ends, so listeners only ever see the coherent final state.
        Reads inside the block still see the mutated store immediately; only
        the change notifications are deferred. Scopes are flushed once each, in
        first-emitted order.

        Flush-on-success only: if the block raises, the queued scopes are
        discarded (never flushed) and the exception propagates — emitting a
        "coherent final state" that was never reached would sync listeners
        to a half-applied transition.
