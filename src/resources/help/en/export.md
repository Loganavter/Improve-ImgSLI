## Exporting Results

- Click the main **Save Result** button to open the feature-rich **Export** dialog.
- In this dialog, you can configure:
  - Output directory and file name.
  - Image format (PNG, JPEG, WEBP, JXL, etc.).
  - Quality/compression levels.
  - An option to fill transparent backgrounds with a custom color.
- **Text Overlays:** If you check **Include file names**, you can use the text settings flyout (✎) to customize the appearance of the filename overlays on the final image, including font size, weight, color, background, and placement.


### Quick Save vs Save Result
- Quick Save (Ctrl+S) uses your last export settings and saves immediately without opening the Export dialog.
- Save Result (Ctrl+Shift+S) opens the Export dialog, allowing you to configure format, quality/compression, and background fill options before saving.

### Video Recording and Export
- Use the **Record**, **Pause**, and **Stop** buttons on the toolbar to record your actions in a comparison session.
- After stopping a recording, click the **Video Editor** button (video icon with a pencil) to open the editing window.
- In the editor, you can:
  - Preview the recorded frames.
  - Trim the beginning and end of the video using the timeline sliders.
  - Configure resolution, FPS, and encoding settings.
  - Export the final video to formats like MP4, WebM, AVI, GIF, etc.

### System Tray and Notifications on Save
- After a successful save, the tray icon menu provides quick access:
  - Open Last Saved File (visible after your first successful save)
  - Open Last Saved Folder
- A system notification may appear on save; clicking the notification opens the last saved folder.
- You can toggle system notifications in Settings.
