## Exporting Results

- Click the main **Save Result** button to open the feature-rich **Export** dialog.
- In this dialog, you can configure:
  - Output directory and file name.
  - Image format (PNG, JPEG, WEBP, etc.).
  - Quality/compression levels.
  - An option to fill transparent backgrounds with a custom color.
- **Text Overlays:** If you check **Include file names**, you can use the text settings flyout (âœŽ) to customize the appearance of the filename overlays on the final image, including font size, weight, color, background, and placement.


### Quick Save vs Save Result
- Quick Save (Ctrl+S) uses your last export settings and saves immediately without opening the Export dialog.
- Save Result (Ctrl+Shift+S) opens the Export dialog, allowing you to configure format, quality/compression, and background fill options before saving.

### System Tray and Notifications on Save
- After a successful save, the tray icon menu provides quick access:
  - Open Last Saved File (visible after your first successful save)
  - Open Last Saved Folder
- A system notification may appear on save; clicking the notification opens the last saved folder.
- You can toggle system notifications in Settings.
