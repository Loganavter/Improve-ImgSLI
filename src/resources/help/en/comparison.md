## Basic Comparison

- When the magnifier is off, you can click and drag the split line to compare different parts of the images.
- Check **Horizontal Split** to change the split orientation.

### Quick Preview
To quickly see one of the original images in full, hold down the **Spacebar**:
- While holding Space, press the **Left Mouse Button** to view Image 1.
- While holding Space, press the **Right Mouse Button** to view Image 2.
- Release the mouse button and Spacebar to return to the comparison view.


### Mouse Wheel Navigation
- When the magnifier is off, scrolling the mouse wheel over the comparison area switches the currently selected image in the list on the side under the cursor (left/right or top/bottom depending on the split orientation).

### Divider Controls
- Divider thickness: scroll the mouse wheel over the Divider Thickness button to adjust the value. A small numeric popup will show the current thickness.
- Divider color: click the Divider Color button to pick a color.

### Quality Metrics (PSNR/SSIM)
- The application can display PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) metrics below the main comparison view.
- By default, these calculations are **disabled** for better performance.
- To enable them, go to **Settings** and check the **"Auto-calculate PSNR"** and **"Auto-calculate SSIM"** options.
