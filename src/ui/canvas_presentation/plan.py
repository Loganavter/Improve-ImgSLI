    The comparison envelope the canvas basis was sized from, in SOURCE space:
    ``(w1, h1, w2, h2)`` of each side's own decoded pixels (not the installed
    display tier). Set by ``plan_builder.build_canvas_plan`` on the live
    default plan only; every downstream owner that fits the pair
    (``display_tier_service.update_common_letterbox_geometry`` /
    ``refresh_live_content_rect``) consumes it instead of re-deriving the
    envelope from ``image1``/``image2``.

    Why source space: each preview is normalised per side to a 1024 long edge,
    so the envelope of a PREVIEW pair has a different aspect than the envelope
    of the source pair (2000x1400 = 1.43 vs 1024x1024 = 1.0). Fitting the
    canvas/split/loupe to the preview aspect and then re-fitting when the
    unified store lands is exactly the "comparison jumps for a frame or two on
    a pair replace" report (2026-10-27).

    ``None`` (default) keeps today's behaviour bit-for-bit: export/snapshot
    plans and an active crop box (the box-clipped display dims are the truth
    there). A frame whose basis cannot be stated consistently sets
    ``envelope_hold`` instead (see below) — it never carries a mix.
    """
    envelope_hold: bool = False
    """
    This frame's pair envelope is a PREVIEW guess on one side, so no consistent
    envelope can be stated: hold the last presented frame instead of applying.

    A preview is normalised per side to a 1024 long edge, so
    ``max(w1,w2) x max(h1,h2)`` over ``(preview1, source2)`` describes neither
    pair (measured live 2026-10-27: canvas ``[1024,1400]`` between two settled
    ``[1600,1400]`` frames while a replaced slot's source tier was still
    decoding). The live apply (``presentation/surface.apply_store_to_canvas``)
    keeps the previously presented frame and its overlays untouched; a held
    frame repeats byte-identically (no re-fit, no geometry change). A blank
    frame is preferable to one that describes neither pair, and the state is
    inherently transient (a preview is installed only until the side's own
    pixels land).

    Set only by ``plan_builder.build_canvas_plan`` on the live default plan;
    ``False`` for export/snapshot plans, crop-box plans, and any frame where
    both sides have a real basis (own pixels or an already-real display).

    """
    Optional composition tree describing N-layer frames (multi-compare grid,
    future scene-graph workspaces). Legacy 2-image comparison plans leave
    this ``None`` and the applicator uses the ``image1`` / ``image2`` path
    unchanged. When set, the applicator routes through composition-aware
    handlers; the legacy fields hold a single-image placeholder so existing
    code paths that read them remain safe.

    Optional source ``CompositionPlan`` (see composition.py), carried through

    ``CompositionPlan`` from ``composition_root``/``canvas_w``/``canvas_h``/
    ``fill_rgba`` alone — that piecemeal rebuild silently drops any field the
    original plan had beyond those four (e.g. multi-compare's
    ``divider_settings``/``label_settings``), which is exactly what starved
    the offscreen exporter of divider/label styling despite the live widget
    (which builds and keeps its own ``CompositionPlan`` directly) rendering
    correctly. Untyped as ``object`` to avoid a hard dependency here; callers
