## üß† Development Story <a name="development-story"></a>

<details>
<summary>Development Story</summary>
The journey of Improve ImgSLI began in September 2024, initially conceived with ChatGPT's assistance to address a personal need for straightforward image comparison in my work. The early version provided basic side-by-side functionality. The following month, October, marked an enhancement phase using Claude, which introduced a magnifier tool and drag-and-drop support, significantly improving usability.

By November, further refinements to the magnifier were implemented with Claude, including view freezing and merging capabilities. However, the codebase's expansion, coupled with Claude's 8k token context limit, made complete code regeneration impractical, necessitating manual integration of new features. Gemini was then employed to help manage these integrations, though not all AI-generated code was directly usable, leading to some features being postponed or temporarily disabled to maintain stability.

A brief period in early December saw an experiment with adaptive magnifier positioning tied to window resizing, which was ultimately set aside due to unsatisfactory results. A turning point came in January 2025 when a user [request](https://github.com/Loganavter/Improve-ImgSLI/issues/1) for dynamic window resizing led to the exploration of DeepSeek. This AI, notable at the time for its Chain-of-Thought reasoning, successfully guided the implementation of this crucial feature, with Gemini then seamlessly incorporating it alongside other updates.

February 2025 brought renewed focus on enhancing the application. Leveraging Claude Sonnet 3.7, features like dynamic image swapping, a multilingual dictionary, and further magnifier improvements were added, along with a helpful tooltip. Shortly thereafter, access to Grok 3‚Äîfirst via X, then its dedicated website‚Äîprovided a significant boost. Grok 3's DeepThink model proved exceptionally effective at resolving persistent bugs, outperforming previous AIs, while its generous query limits and intelligent standard model streamlined development. Key contributions included optimized rendering, filename display and editing, and fixes for fullscreen mode.

Late March 2025 was dedicated to cross-platform compatibility. Gemini and Grok, using their web search capabilities, assisted in drafting build and packaging scripts. While initial hopes for community maintenance of platform builds didn't materialize due to some skepticism about the project's AI-assisted origins, this solo effort, though time-intensive (taking considerable effort per platform), led to the discovery and resolution of several bugs, culminating in a successful cross-platform launch. Delays in Flathub publication until mid-April allowed for further bug fixes and the addition of a list cleanup feature.

In April 2025, attention shifted back to addressing critical bugs, with continued reliance on Gemini. A major achievement during this period was the implementation of window state persistence‚Äîa feature that proved incredibly challenging but vastly improved user experience. A settings tab was also introduced, centralizing language selection, output image quality, and filename length preferences. Following these updates, Windows and Flatpak builds were refreshed. The current plan involves implementing one final feature and verifying the Flatpak maintenance pipeline before updating Windows and AUR builds, after which the project will likely enter a period of stability.

Excluding the value of approximately four weeks of personal development time, the direct monetary cost of this project has been around $30. The AUR maintainer's contribution was voluntary and is gratefully acknowledged.</details>

## üí¨ My Personal View <a name="my-personal-view"></a>

<details>
<summary>My personal view on project<a name="my-personal-view"></summary>
The genesis of Improve ImgSLI was a practical need: to create clear visual comparisons for an article. The initial design, and indeed the name, drew inspiration from imgsli.com. While the early iterations were functional, the project has since evolved significantly.

Today, I view Improve ImgSLI as a valuable public asset, much like VideoCut Kahive, another tool whose principles partially guided its development and which has become indispensable in my own workflow. The core value of Improve ImgSLI lies in its efficiency. Manually creating detailed image comparisons can be a laborious process, often taking several minutes and requiring familiarity with tools like ffmpeg for precise cropping without re-encoding. This program accomplishes the same, often superior, results in approximately 30 seconds, all through an intuitive, user-friendly interface. It's this transformation of a cumbersome task into a swift, accessible one that I believe makes Improve ImgSLI a genuinely useful tool.
