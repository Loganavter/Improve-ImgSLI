## 🧠 Development Story

Improve-ImgSLI started as a personal experiment born out of necessity. I was constantly switching between various upscaling and enhancement tools and needed a fast, flexible, and visually intuitive way to compare outputs — without quality loss or UI constraints. What began as a simple image splitter evolved into a full-featured visual comparison suite, thanks to suggestions and contributions from the community.

Every iteration of Improve-ImgSLI was informed by real-world usage, trial and error, and the feedback of people who saw value in what it offered. The project's growth mirrors the same kind of visual refinement that its own tools are designed to help evaluate.

---

## 💬 My Personal View

I built this tool to serve my own needs — it was never originally meant to be anything big. But as I shared it with others, I realized that many people were searching for the same kind of clarity in image comparison workflows.

There are plenty of technical tools out there, but I believe Improve-ImgSLI strikes a balance between simplicity and power. Whether you're comparing AI upscaling results, sharpening filters, noise reduction techniques, or simple edits, it should feel effortless and precise.

I'm grateful to everyone who's given feedback, reported bugs, or simply used the app and found it useful. You're the reason I keep refining it.
