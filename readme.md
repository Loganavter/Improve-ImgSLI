<summary>üìñ <strong>Development Story</strong> <a name="development-story"></a></summary>

After encountering countless issues with ImageSplit tools crashing or being buggy, I created this improved version from the ground up. It focuses on image comparison, preserving high-resolution details, and enabling pixel-level analysis with smooth tools.

Everything was crafted with usability in mind ‚Äî from the intuitive magnifier and marker to dropdown menus and customizable text.

My journey with this tool involved rigorous testing and frequent tweaks to ensure it feels natural to anyone using it ‚Äî even for the first time. Its performance scales well across systems, making it accessible and lightweight despite being powerful.

<summary>üí¨ <strong>My personal view on project</strong> <a name="my-personal-view"></a></summary>

This is not just a tool; it's something I personally rely on during upscale comparisons or detailed analysis. It began as a side project, but it grew into something that truly reflects my own workflow needs and vision.

If you find this tool useful, please consider giving it a ‚≠ê star ‚Äî it helps visibility and motivates me to continue polishing it.
